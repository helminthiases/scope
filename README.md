**Predicting the Prevalence of Soil Transmitted Helminth Infections**

<br>

# Project Scope

<br>

Soil transmitted helminths (STH) are parasitic intestinal worms that cause intestinal nematode infections such as ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm disease.  According to the [2017 global burden of disease metrics](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/vol392no10159/PIIS0140-6736(18)X0048-8), by The Lancet, soil transmitted helminths infections are

* The second most burdensome [<a href="#@Kyu2018">Kyu 2018</a>], after dengue: The 2017 all-age global burden level is 1920k (1200k to 2980k) disability adjusted life years.
* The most prevalent [<a href="#@James2018">James 2018</a>].

Therefore, STH infections are a focus of the World Health Organization (WHO).  Soil transmitted helminths prevention, control, and
elimination activities depend on knowledge of prevalence [<a href="#@Montresor2011">Montresor2011</a>].  These prevalence metrics depend on field
surveys, which are rather expensive to conduct. They are especially expensive when there are no measures to systematically/strategically
direct field scientists to survey areas.  In the absence of systematic/strategic direction, the field scientists have to survey as wide an area as possible, probably subject to constraints such as finances, accessibility, etc.

<br>

Hence, this project aims to develop a model that predicts the STH prevalence of an area, without depending on past or present field prevalence values.  Instead, the model's independent variables will be based on domain expert understandings, recommendations, of the geospatial, demographic, and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables that influence the transmission of STH.
