**Predicting the Prevalence of Soil Transmitted Helminth Infections**

<br>

## Project Scope

<br>

Soil transmitted helminths (STH) are parasitic intestinal worms that cause intestinal nematode infections such as ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm disease.  According to the [2017 global burden of disease metrics](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/vol392no10159/PIIS0140-6736(18)X0048-8), by The Lancet, soil transmitted helminths infections are

* The second most burdensome [<a href="#@Kyu2018">4</a>], after dengue: The 2017 all-age global burden level is 1920k (1200k to 2980k) disability adjusted life years.
* The most prevalent [<a href="#@James2018">3</a>].

Therefore, STH infections are a focus of the World Health Organization (WHO).  Soil transmitted helminths prevention, control, and
elimination activities depend on knowledge of prevalence [<a href="#@Montresor2011">1</a>].  Prevalence metrics depend on field
surveys, which are rather expensive to conduct. They are especially expensive when there are no measures to systematically/strategically
direct field scientists to survey areas.  In the absence of systematic/strategic direction, the field scientists have to survey as wide an area as 
possible, albeit subject to financial, accessibility, etc., constraints. 

<br>

Hence, this project's focus is STH prevalence prediction. A key STH prevalence hypothesis, of domain experts, is that WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) 
variables might be critical prognostic factors.  Therefore, the project will focus on understanding the association between STH
prevalence and WASH variables, and investigate whether they improve STH prevalence prediction.

## Project Aim

> Understanding the association between STH (Soil Transmitted Helminth) prevalence and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables, 
> and their effect, or otherwise, on STH prevalence prediction.

<br>


## Project Objectives

Hence, the project's objectives are to

> * Understand the association between STH (Soil Transmitted Helminth) prevalence and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) variables
>
> * Determine the extent to which WASH variables aid STH prevalence prediction via geostatistical models.

<br>

## Project Data

The project will rely on the

* The soil transmitted helminths' data sets of [ESPEN](https://espen.afro.who.int/) (Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases) -- 
  **for** ascariasis, hookworm infection, and trichuriasis examinations and cases data per site.

* The estimated WASH variables of [IHME](https://www.healthdata.org/research-article/mapping-geographic-inequalities-access-drinking-water-and-sanitation-facilities-low) 
  (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation) -- **for** determining site level WASH variables values. The [ESPEN estimates](https://espen.afro.who.int/diseases/wash), which 
  depend on the IHME methodology, are implementation level estimates.

* The [National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets), [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html), 
  and [DIVA GIS](https://www.diva-gis.org/Data) -- **for** historical geospatial and/or climatic variables values.
