**Project Scope**

<br>


### Project Aim

> Develop a STH (Soil Transmitted Helminth) prevalence prediction model via **(a)** geospatial, **(b)** demographic, and 
> **(c)** WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) **prognostic factors**.

<br>
<br>

### Project Objectives

> * Investigate geospatial, demographic, and WASH prognostic factors of STH prevalence.
> * Specifically determine whether <br>
    &diams; site level sanitation <br>
    &diams; population density <br>
>   are prognostic factors of STH prevalence
> * Develop a STH prediction model.

### Approval Process

The focus herein is timely feedback

<br>

#### Approval of deliveries

Per each piece of work delivered

* Antonio Montresor shall provide written feedback.
  
* If more than one World Health Organization (WHO) stakeholder might provide feedback, then Antonio Montresor 
  shall provide a written summary/consolidation of the WHO stakeholders' feedback. 
  
* Antonio Montresor shall ensure that all WHO stakeholders that should provide feedback, do.

<br>
<br>


### 3. Out of Scope

* Prediction of STH Prevalence for countries outwith the continent of Africa <br>
  Because the ESPEN data project focuses on African countries only, model development will be (a) via the data of one or
  more African countries, and (b) for one or more African countries only.




### 4. Project Assumptions

* The soil transmitted helminth parasites of concern are roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), hookworms 
  (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus), and whipworms (Trichuris trichiura); which cause 
  ascariasis, hookworm infection, and trichuriasis, respectively.
* The historical site level positive cases of ascariasis, hookworm infection, and trichuriasis, detailed by ESPEN, are dependable.
* Ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm infection examinations, per site, are conducted within the same sample site population.


### 5. Project Constraints

Variable | Comment
:--- | :---
Project start date | 6 June 2022
Project end date | 9 September 2022
Deadlines | Masters Thesis: 9 September 2022, Poster Session: 16 September 2022


#### Time Constraints

* The final week of the masters modules overlaps with the first week of the masters project, therefore only a third of the week 
  ending 10 June 2022 shall be spent on the masters project.


#### Budget Constraints

The project has no budget, i.e., no budget/payment for personnel or computational resources used.

#### Quality Constraints

#### Equipment Constraints

No equipment has been provided for this project.  The project's tasks will be, are, conducted via a personal computer.  However, it 
is quite probable that the computer will stop working any time soon; the computer is quite old, and in recent times bits & pieces 
have stopped working.  Hence, access to a fall-back laptop is critical.
