    abstract = "{Interventions to reduce undernutrition and improve child growth have incorporated improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) as part of disease transmission prevention strategies. Knowledge gaps still exist, namely, when and which WASH factors are determinants for growth faltering, and when WASH interventions are most effective at improving growth. This study drew cross-sectional data from a longitudinal cohort study and used hierarchical regression analyses to assess associations between WASH factors: water index, sanitation, hygiene index, and growth: height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ) at 1, 6, and 12 months postpartum among infants a priori born healthy in Soweto, Johannesburg. Household access to sanitation facilities that were not safely managed was associated with a decrease in HAZ scores at 1 month (β = −2.24) and 6 months (β = −0.96); a decrease in WAZ at 1 month (β = −1.21), 6 months (β = −1.57), and 12 months (β = −1.92); and finally, with WHZ scores at 12 months (β = −1.94). Counterintuitively, poorer scores on the hygiene index were associated with an increase at 1 month for both HAZ (β = 0.53) and WAZ (β = 0.44). Provision of safely managed sanitation at household and community levels may be required before improvements in growth-related outcomes are obtained.}",
